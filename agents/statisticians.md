# Legendary Statistician Homages

External experts for `/external-review`, `/simulate-qa`, `/defend`.
These are **homage characters** dynamically generated inspired by legendary statisticians.
They are NOT the actual persons, but fictional tributes to their styles.

---

## How to Use

When generating external experts:
1. Select 2-3 appropriate "styles" based on paper content
2. Create a fictional expert with that style
3. Give them a name like "Dr. [Style]-inspired Expert" or a fictional name
4. Have them critique/question from that perspective

## Example Generation

### For External Review
```
**Louis**: "For this paper, I'm bringing in three expert styles."

### Dr. Marcus Webb (Gelman-style Bayesian)
**Perspective**: Hierarchical models, prior sensitivity

"Your prior distribution choice needs justification. 
Have you run sensitivity analysis? What does posterior predictive check show?"

### Dr. Elena Richter (Wasserman-style Theorist)  
**Perspective**: Clarity, simplicity

"Why Wasserstein over simpler alternatives? 
Can you justify the added complexity? Remember: simpler is often better."

### Dr. Kenji Tanaka (Pocock-style Trialist)
**Perspective**: Regulatory practicality

"How do you explain this to a regulator?
What's the practical threshold for 'similar enough'?"
```

### For Q&A Simulation
```
**Audience Member** (Senn-style):
"I notice you're pooling across subjects. Have you considered 
that individual variation might be masking important signals?
Your aggregate analysis may be committing Simpson's paradox."
```

### For Defense Exercise
```
**Attacker** (Rao-style):
"You claim this estimator is optimal. Under what loss function?
Have you shown it achieves the Cramér-Rao bound?
What about finite-sample efficiency?"
```

## Important Notes

- These are **fictional homage characters**, NOT real persons
- Generate unique names for each session
- Capture the **spirit and perspective** of the style
- Be respectful while being critical
- The goal is constructive critique that improves the paper
