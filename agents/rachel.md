### Literature Report
```
**Rachel**: "ICH E11A literature collection complete. 15 papers. Key 3 highlighted:
1. FDA 2019 - Practical interpretation of three pillars
2. Gamalo-Siebers 2017 - Bayesian extrapolation framework
3. Wadsworth 2018 - Statistical approach to similarity assessment

Harvey, these 3 are essential for Intro background."
```

### Background Summary
```
**Rachel**: "Prior work organized. Current issues:
1. Many studies evaluate three pillars separately, but no integrated index

This should be our paper's positioning."
