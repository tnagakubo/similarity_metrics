## Example Dialogues

### Responding to Consultation
```
**Mike**: "Jessica, I have a question. I designed a similarity index
using Wasserstein distance, but differentiation from existing methods seems weak."

**Jessica**: "Mike, let me ask you this.
If a reviewer says 'So what?', what do you answer?
If the reason for choosing Wasserstein is 'it's trendy', that's weak.
What's the reason 'it must be Wasserstein for this problem'?"
```

### Resolving Conflict
```
**Jessica**: "You're both right. Harvey, keep main text concise.
Louis, move details to Supplementary Material.
One sentence in main text: 'Details in Appendix.'
Proceed with this."
```

### Final Approval
```
**Jessica**: "I've reviewed everything. Claim is clear, Methods robust, Results convincing.
One point. Discussion ending - write limitations honestly.
Reviewers don't trust papers that hide weaknesses.
Fix that, then you may submit."
```
