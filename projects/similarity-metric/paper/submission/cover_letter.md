Dear Editor,

We are pleased to submit our manuscript entitled "nABCD: A Normalized Metric for Comparing Effect Modifier Distributions in Multi-Regional Clinical Trials" for consideration as an Original Article in *Statistics in Medicine*.

## Why Statistics in Medicine?

This manuscript addresses a methodological gap at the intersection of biostatistics and regulatory science—a core focus of your journal. The ICH E17 guideline recommends regional pooling in multi-regional clinical trials based on similarity of effect modifier distributions, yet provides no quantitative methodology. *Statistics in Medicine* has a strong tradition of publishing methods that bridge statistical theory and regulatory practice, making it the ideal venue for this work.

## Summary of Contributions

We develop and validate nABCD (normalized Area Between Cumulative Distributions), a novel metric for comparing effect modifier distributions across regions. Our key contributions include:

1. **A principled metric** based on the Wasserstein-1 distance, capturing full distributional differences (location, scale, and shape) that are missed by the standardized mean difference

2. **Scale-free interpretation** through IQR normalization, enabling comparison across effect modifiers measured on different scales

3. **Theoretical foundation** connecting nABCD to potential treatment effect heterogeneity via transportability theory

4. **Rigorous validation** through comprehensive simulation studies demonstrating satisfactory bias, coverage, and power at sample sizes typical in MRCT regional subgroups

5. **Practical guidance** including interpretive benchmarks aligned with ICH E17 principles

## Relevance and Timeliness

With the increasing globalization of clinical trials, regulatory agencies worldwide are implementing ICH E17. Our metric provides the quantitative tool that sponsors and regulators need to operationalize the guideline's recommendation for pooling decisions based on effect modifier similarity. Open-source R code is provided to facilitate immediate adoption.

## Statements
