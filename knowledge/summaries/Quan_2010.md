## Overview

This paper from the **MRCT Cross-Functional Key Issue Team** provides a comprehensive framework for assessing **consistency of treatment effects** across regions in multiregional clinical trials (MRCTs). It introduces **5 formal definitions** of consistency and derives sample size formulas for each definition. This is a foundational paper for regulatory discussions on regional consistency.

## Key Problem Addressed

> "Heterogeneity resulting from differences in ethnicity, genetic factors, culture, and clinical practice across regions can present challenges for the conduct and interpretation of multiregional clinical trials (MRCTs)."

The paper addresses: How do we formally define and test for "consistency" of treatment effects across regions?

## Five Definitions of Consistency

### Definition 1: Observed Region Effects Exceed a Specified Proportion of Overall Effect

**Criterion**: All observed regional treatment effects should be at least half (or some proportion π) of the overall treatment effect.

$$\hat{\delta}_i > \pi \hat{\delta}, \quad i = 1, \ldots, s$$

where:
- $\hat{\delta}_i$ = observed treatment effect in region $i$
- $\hat{\delta}$ = overall treatment effect
- $s$ = number of regions
- $\pi$ = pre-specified proportion (typically 0.5)

**Properties**:
- Simple to interpret
- Does NOT require statistical significance in each region
- Probability of claiming consistency depends on sample sizes

### Definition 2: Observed Region Effects Exceed a Specified Effect Size

**Criterion**: All observed regional treatment effects exceed a pre-specified clinically meaningful threshold $\delta_0$.

$$\hat{\delta}_i > \delta_0, \quad i = 1, \ldots, s$$

**Application**: When absolute effect size matters more than proportion of overall effect.

### Definition 3: Preservation of Overall Significance in Subpopulations

**Criterion**: If a region is "rejected" (effect < 0) and $H_0$ is accepted (not significant), then consistency is claimed if the effect of remaining regions is robust.

Based on Japanese guidance requiring at least 1/3 of global treatment effect preserved in Japan.

### Definition 4: Absence of Significant Treatment-by-Region Interaction

**Criterion**: No statistically significant heterogeneity across regions.

$$P(\text{reject } H_0: \tau^2 = 0) < \alpha$$

where $\tau^2$ is the between-region variance.

**Limitation**: Low power to detect true heterogeneity.

### Definition 5: Lack of Significant Difference for Any Regions from the Overall

**Criterion**: None of the individual region effects differs significantly from the overall effect.

$$|\hat{\delta}_i - \hat{\delta}| < z_\alpha \cdot SE, \quad \forall i$$

**Modified version**: Excludes the one-sided individual hypothesis if the region effect is not consistent with the overall.

## Key Notation

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| $\delta$ | True overall treatment effect |
| $\delta_i$ | True treatment effect in region $i$ |
| $\hat{\delta}, \hat{\delta}_i$ | Observed estimates |
| $s$ | Number of regions |
| $n_i$ | Sample size in region $i$ |
| $N$ | Total sample size |
| $f_i = n_i/N$ | Proportion of subjects in region $i$ |
| $\pi$ | Minimum proportion of overall effect (Definition 1) |
| $\tau^2$ | Between-region variance |

## Sample Size Formulas

### For Definition 1 (Equal Sample Sizes)
Under assumption of equal regional effects:

$$N = \left[\frac{\delta^2}{2\sigma^2(\tau_\alpha + z_\beta)^2} - \frac{\tau^2}{2\sigma^2}\sum_{i=1}^{s} f_i^2 \right]^{-1}$$

### For Random Effect Model
When region effect is random:

$$\hat{\delta}^R = \sum_{i=1}^{s} w_i \hat{\delta}_i / \sum_{i=1}^{s} w_i$$

where $w_i = 1/(\tau^2 + 2\sigma^2/N)$.

## Key Tables

### Table 1: Unconditional and Conditional Probabilities for Definitions 1-5

Shows probability of claiming consistency for various configurations of:
- Effect size ratios (δ = 0.8σ, δ = 0.9σ)
- Number of regions (s = 3 or 4)
- Sample size allocations
- Different definitions

**Key finding**: Definition 1 with π = 0.5 gives reasonable probabilities (70-80%) when true regional effects are similar.

### Table 5: Sample Sizes for 80% Power

| Regions | Definition 1 | Definition 2 | Definition 4 |
|---------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| 3 equal | 252 | 252 | 252 |
| 4 equal | 232 | 232 | 232 |
| Japan emphasis | Higher | Higher | Higher |

## Important Considerations

### Random Effect Model
When region effects are considered random:
$$(\hat{\delta}_i | \delta_i) \sim N(\delta_i, 2\sigma^2/N) \text{ and } \delta_i \sim N(\delta, \tau^2)$$

### Non-Inferiority Trials
Different approaches needed:
- Definition 1 may not apply directly
- Methods based on preserving non-inferiority margin across regions

### Binary Endpoint (Survival Analysis)
For hazard ratios, define:
$$\delta = \frac{\lambda_T(t) + \lambda_P(t)}{\lambda_P(t)} = \frac{\lambda_T(t)}{\lambda_P(t)} + 1$$

where $\lambda_T, \lambda_P$ are hazard functions for treatment and placebo.

## Relevance to SEMD Project

### Complementary Approaches

| Quan et al. (2010) | SEMD |
|-------------------|------|
| Tests **observed** effect consistency | Measures **distribution** similarity of effect modifiers |
| Post-hoc assessment | Pre-hoc justification for pooling |
| Requires trial data | Can use external/historical data |
| Binary (consistent/not) | Continuous measure of similarity |

### Key Connection

Quan et al. focus on **treatment effect** consistency across regions. SEMD addresses **why** effects might differ - through effect modifier distributions. If effect modifier distributions are similar (small SEMD), then treatment effects are more likely to be consistent.

### Quote for SEMD Paper

From Discussion (p.629):
> "In an MRCT, there is no prior reason to expect that the effect within a region is likely to differ substantially from other regions—perhaps based upon genetics, pharmacokinetics, disease biology, local culture, or medical practice—then region need not have a separate analysis."

This implies: **Similar effect modifier distributions → No need for separate regional analysis**
