## Overview

ICH E17 provides a harmonized framework for planning and designing **Multi-Regional Clinical Trials (MRCTs)** - clinical trials conducted in more than one region under a single protocol. The guideline addresses how to assess regional variability, justify pooling strategies, and evaluate consistency of treatment effects across regions and subpopulations.

## Key Definitions (Section 3: Glossary)

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Consistency of treatment effect** | A lack of clinically relevant differences between treatment effects in different regions or subpopulations of an MRCT |
| **Multi-Regional Clinical Trial (MRCT)** | A clinical trial conducted in more than one region under a single protocol |
| **Region** | A geographical region, country or regulatory region |
| **Regulatory Region** | A region comprised of countries for which a common set of regulatory requirements applies (e.g., EU) |
| **Pooled regions** | Pooling some geographical regions at the planning stage, if subjects are thought to be **similar enough with respect to intrinsic and/or extrinsic factors** relevant to the disease and/or drug under study |
| **Pooled subpopulations** | Pooling a subset of subjects from a particular region with similarly defined subsets from other regions whose members **share one or more intrinsic or extrinsic factors** important for the drug development programme |

## Key Sections for SEMD Project

### Section 2.2.1: Pre-consideration of Regional Variability

**Critical concept**: Regional treatment effect differences can arise from differences in **intrinsic and extrinsic factors** that may act as **effect modifiers**.

#### Four Categories of Factors Affecting Regional Variability:

1. **Intrinsic factors** (patient-related):
   - Genetic polymorphisms
   - Age, sex, body weight
   - Organ function
   - Disease type/severity/stage
   - Prior treatment, concomitant illness

2. **Extrinsic factors** (environment-related):
   - Medical practice/standard of care
   - Diet, environmental factors
   - Socioeconomic/educational factors
   - Regulatory requirements

3. **Factors affecting drug exposure**:
   - PK differences due to intrinsic factors
   - Differences in compliance/dosing

4. **Factors affecting trial conduct**:
   - Differences in endpoint assessment
   - Investigator training
   - Protocol compliance

**Figure 2 (p.8)**: Illustrates how intrinsic/extrinsic factors modulate regional treatment response differences.

### Section 2.2.5: Sample Size Planning - Pooled Regions and Pooled Subpopulations

**KEY QUOTE (p.16-17)**:
> "The pooling strategy should be justified based on the distribution of the intrinsic and extrinsic factors known to affect the treatment response, and the disease under investigation and **similarity of those factors across regions**."

**Pooling justification requires**:
- Scientific rationale based on factor similarity
- Pre-specification in study protocol and SAP
- Monitoring of factor distributions during trial

**Examples of valid pooling**:
- Canada + United States → "North American region" (similar medical practices, concomitant medications)
- Hispanics in North/South America (ethnicity crosses regional boundaries)
- Caucasians in Europe + North America (genotype-based pooling)

### Section 2.2.7: Statistical Analysis Planning

#### Primary Analysis (p.20)
Four key considerations:
1. Target population
2. Endpoints/variables of primary interest
3. **Relevant intrinsic and extrinsic factors** in the multi-regional, multi-subpopulation context
4. Population-level summary of data required

#### Examination of Consistency across Regions and Subpopulations (p.21-22)

**Definition**: Consistency = **lack of clinically relevant differences** between treatment effects in different regions or subpopulations.

**Analytical approaches** (may be combined):
1. Descriptive summaries
2. Graphical displays (e.g., forest plots)
3. Model-based estimation including covariate-adjusted analysis
4. Test of treatment-by-region interaction (note: often has very low power)

**Structured exploration of regional differences** (p.21-22):
1. Evaluate factors known a priori to vary among regions and hypothesized to be prognostic/predictive
   - Disease severity, race, smoking, BMI
   - Medical practice, concomitant medications
   - Genetic factors (e.g., drug metabolizing enzyme polymorphisms)

2. For unexpected regional differences, examine:
   - Prognostic factors known for the disease
   - Whether factor distributions differ between regions
   - "If the distribution of a prognostic factor is found to differ between regions, then apparent regional differences in treatment effects may be explained by differences in the prognostic factors"

3. Post-hoc investigation for unexplained differences

#### Estimation of Regional Treatment Effects (p.22-23)

- Covariate-adjusted models account for intrinsic/extrinsic factors
- Weighted averages of overall and regional estimates (shrinkage estimators)
- Borrowing information from other regions using appropriate statistical models
- Sensitivity analyses for model assumptions

## Relevance to SEMD Project

### Direct Justification for SEMD

ICH E17 explicitly states that **pooling strategy should be justified based on similarity of intrinsic/extrinsic factor distributions across regions**. SEMD provides exactly this:

$$\text{SEMD}(R_1, R_2) = \int |f_1(x) - f_2(x)| |g(x)| dx$$

Where:
- $f_1, f_2$ = effect modifier distributions in regions 1 and 2
- $g(x)$ = effect function (how the modifier affects treatment response)
- Small SEMD → similar distributions → valid pooling

### Key Regulatory Quotes for Paper

1. **Pooling justification** (p.16-17):
   > "The pooling strategy should be justified based on the distribution of the intrinsic and extrinsic factors known to affect the treatment response"

2. **Regional difference explanation** (p.21):
   > "If the distribution of a prognostic factor is found to differ between regions, then apparent regional differences in treatment effects may be explained by differences in the prognostic factors"

3. **Consistency definition** (p.26):
   > "Consistency of treatment effect: A lack of clinically relevant differences between treatment effects in different regions or subpopulations"

4. **Pooled regions definition** (p.26):
   > "Pooling some geographical regions at the planning stage, if subjects in those regions are thought to be similar enough with respect to intrinsic and/or extrinsic factors"

### SEMD Paper Connection

| ICH E17 Requirement | SEMD Contribution |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| Justify pooling based on factor similarity | SEMD quantifies distribution similarity |
| Evaluate consistency across regions | Bootstrap CI for SEMD provides formal test |
| Account for factor distributions in analysis | SEMD explicitly models $f_1, f_2$ distributions |
| Pre-specify pooling strategy | SEMD threshold can be pre-specified |

## Sample Size Allocation Approaches (Section 2.2.5)

Five approaches discussed:
1. **Proportional Allocation**: Based on region size and disease prevalence
2. **Equal Allocation**: Equal numbers per region
3. **Preservation of Effect**: Maintain specified proportion of overall effect
4. **Local Significance**: Achieve significant results within each region
5. **Fixed Minimum Number**: Minimum subjects per region

**Recommendation**: Balance between proportional and equal allocation.
