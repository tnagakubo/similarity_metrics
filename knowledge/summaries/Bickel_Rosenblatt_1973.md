## Abstract
Density estimates of the usual type generated by weight functions are considered. Limit theorems are obtained for the maximum of the normalized deviation of the estimate from its expected value, and for quadratic norms of the same quantity. Using these results, the behavior of tests of goodness-of-fit and confidence regions based on these statistics are studied.

## Key Results for SEMD Project

### Density Estimator Definition
$$f_n(x) = \frac{1}{nb(n)} \sum_{j=1}^{n} w\left(\frac{x - X_j}{b(n)}\right)$$

where:
- $w$ is a weight (kernel) function
- $b(n)$ is bandwidth with $b(n) \to 0$ and $n^{-1} = o(b(n))$

### Assumptions (A1-A4)

**A1**: Weight function $w$ assigns mass one to the line and either:
- (a) vanishes outside $[-A, A]$ and is absolutely continuous on $[-A, A]$
- (b) is absolutely continuous on $(-\infty, \infty)$ with integrable derivative

**A2**: The density $f$ is continuous, positive, and bounded.

**A3**: The function $f^{1/2}$ is absolutely continuous and its derivative $\frac{1}{2}f'/f^{1/2}$ is bounded in absolute value.

**A4**: The second derivative $f''$ of $f$ exists and is bounded. Moreover $w$ is symmetric about 0 and $z^2w(z)$ is integrable.

### Main Theorem (Corollary on Confidence Bands)

Let assumptions A1-A4 be satisfied with $b(n) = n^{-\delta}$, $\frac{1}{5} < \delta < \frac{1}{2}$.

Then:
$$\lim_{n \to \infty} P\left[ f(x) \leq f_n(x) + \left(\frac{f_n(x)\lambda(w)}{nb(n)}\right)^{1/2} \left(\frac{z}{(2\delta \log n)^{1/2}} + d_n\right) \text{ for all } 0 \leq x \leq 1 \right] = e^{-2e^{-z}}$$

where:
- $\lambda(w) = \int w^2(t) dt$
- $d_n$ is a centering constant depending on $w$ and $n$

### Theorem for Integrated Squared Error (Section 4)

**Theorem 4.1**: Let A1-A3 hold and suppose $a$ is integrable piecewise continuous and bounded. Then:
$$b^{-1}(n)(T_n - \int f(x)a(x) dx \int w^2(z) dz)$$
is asymptotically normally distributed with mean 0 and variance:
$$2(w * \bar{w})^{(2)}(0) \int a^2(x) f^2(x) dx$$

where $\bar{w}(t) = w(-t)$ and $*$ denotes convolution.

### Quadratic Functional (Equation 4.1)
$$T_n = nb(n) \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} [f_n(x) - E(f_n(x))]^2 a(x) dx$$

**Key result**: $T_n$ is asymptotically Gaussian under appropriate conditions.

## Relevance to SEMD

### 1. Uniform Convergence Rate
From Proposition 2.1:
$$||Y_n - {}_0Y_n|| = O_p(b^{-1/2}(n) n^{-1/2} (\log n)^{1/2} (\log \log n)^{1/2})$$

This establishes the rate at which KDE converges uniformly to the true density.

### 2. Application to SEMD's Theorem 1

For SEMD, we need:
$$\sup_x |\hat{f}_k(x) - f_k(x)| = O_p\left(\sqrt{\frac{\log n}{nh}}\right)$$

This paper provides the foundation:
- **Equation 2.6**: $||Z_n^0 - Z^0|| = O_p(n^{-1/4}(\log n)^{1/2}(\log \log n)^{1/2})$
- Combined with bandwidth choice, yields uniform convergence

### 3. Weighted Integrals
The treatment of functionals like:
$$\int [f_n(x) - f(x)]^2 a(x) dx$$

directly applies to SEMD where $a(x) = |g(x)|^2$ or related weight.

### 4. Asymptotic Distribution
The paper shows that properly normalized KDE-based statistics converge to Gaussian limits - exactly what we need for Theorem 1 (Asymptotic Normality) of SEMD.

## Technical Notes

### Skorohod Embedding
The paper uses Skorohod-like embedding to approximate the empirical process by Brownian motion, enabling precise asymptotic analysis.

### Bandwidth Selection
Results require $b(n) = n^{-\delta}$ with $\frac{1}{5} < \delta < \frac{1}{2}$.
- Silverman's rule: $h \propto n^{-1/5}$ ($\delta = 1/5$) is at the boundary
- Optimal for MISE: $\delta = 1/5$
- For uniform convergence: need $\delta > 1/5$

### Connection to Total Variation
SEMD generalizes Total Variation with weight:
$$TV(f_1, f_2) = \frac{1}{2} \int |f_1(x) - f_2(x)| dx$$
$$SEMD = \int |f_1(x) - f_2(x)| |g(x)| dx$$

The asymptotic theory for KDE from this paper extends to both.

## Appendix Results (from Image Reading)

### Theorem A1 (Nonstationary Gaussian Processes)
For separable Gaussian processes $Y_T(\cdot)$ with mean $\mu_T(\cdot)$ and covariance $r(\cdot)$:

Let $M_T = \max\{Y_T(t): 0 \leq t \leq T\}$, $m_T = \min\{Y_T(t): 0 \leq t \leq T\}$.

Under conditions (i)-(vi), including:
- $b_T(t)$ uniformly bounded
- $r(t) = 1 - C|t|^\alpha + o(|t|^\alpha)$, $0 < \alpha \leq 2$
- $\int_0^\infty r^2(t) dt < \infty$

Then $U_T = (2 \log T)^{1/2}(M_T - B(T))$ and $V_T = -(2 \log T)^{1/2}(m_T + B(T))$ are asymptotically independent with:
$$P[U_T < z] \to e^{-\lambda_1 e^{-z}}, \quad P[V_T < z] \to e^{-\lambda_2 e^{-z}}$$

### Theorem B1-B3 (Covariance Function Properties)
For absolutely continuous $w$ with square integrable derivative:
$$r(t) = \int w(t+s)w(s) \, ds$$

is twice differentiable with:
$$r'(0) = -r_-'(0) = -\frac{1}{2}(w^2(A) + w^2(-A))$$
