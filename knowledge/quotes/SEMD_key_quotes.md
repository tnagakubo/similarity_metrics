# Key Quotes for SEMD Paper

## Introduction Quotes

### Quote 1: ICH E17 Regulatory Requirement
**Source**: ICH E17 (2017) Section 2.2.5 "Pooled Regions and Pooled Subpopulations"

> "The pooling strategy should be justified based on the distribution of the intrinsic and extrinsic factors known to affect the treatment response, and similarity of those factors across regions."

**Usage**: Establishes regulatory mandate for distribution-based pooling justification.

### Quote 2: Clinical Significance of Effect Modifiers
**Source**: VanderWeele & Knol (2014) Section 1.1

> "It may be important to identify the subgroups of individuals in which the intervention or treatment is likely to have the largest effect."

**Usage**: Justifies clinical importance of measuring effect modifier distributions.

### Quote 3: Position Statement (Our Contribution)
**Source**: SEMD Paper (Original)

> "SEMD provides a quantitative measure to address ICH E17's requirement for distribution-based pooling justification, enabling pre-trial assessment of regional similarity."

**Usage**: Summarizes our novel contribution and differentiates from post-hoc consistency tests.

## Supporting Quotes

### ICH E17: Consistency Definition
**Source**: ICH E17 (2017) Glossary

> "Consistency of treatment effect across regions: A lack of clinically relevant differences between treatment effects in different regions of a multi-regional clinical trial."

### ICH E17: Pooled Regions Justification
**Source**: ICH E17 (2017) Section 2.2.5

> "Regions may be pooled for randomisation and/or analysis if subjects are thought to be similar enough with respect to intrinsic and/or extrinsic factors that may influence treatment effects."

### VanderWeele: Scale Dependence
**Source**: VanderWeele & Knol (2014) Section 1.5

> "Interaction can be present on one scale but absent on another."

**Usage**: Supports the need for distribution-level comparison rather than single-scale effect comparison.

### Quan et al.: Pre-Trial Assumption
**Source**: Quan et al. (2010) Discussion

> "In an MRCT, if there is no prior reason to expect that the effect within a region is likely to differ substantially from other regions—perhaps based upon genetics, pharmacokinetics, disease biology, local culture, or medical practice—then region need not have a separate analysis."

**Usage**: SEMD provides the "prior reason" (or lack thereof) mentioned here.

## Introduction Logical Flow

1. **Problem**: ICH E17 requires distribution-based pooling justification (Quote 1)
2. **Significance**: Effect modifiers determine treatment heterogeneity (Quote 2)
3. **Gap**: No quantitative measure currently exists
4. **Solution**: SEMD fills this gap (Quote 3)
5. **Distinction**: Pre-trial justification vs. post-hoc consistency testing
